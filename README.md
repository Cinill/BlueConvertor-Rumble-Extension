# USB Gamepad force feedback driver
This project implements a simple feedback driver for cheap USB Gamepads that works on Windows 8 / 10. I started this project because I couldn't find anywhere a driver that works on anything but Windows 7.

It works with gamepads that identify themselves as VID=0x0079 and PID=0x0006. Mine looks like the one in this picture:
